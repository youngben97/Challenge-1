# Challenge 1 - Benjamin Young

## This repo contains code that has been refactored for accessibility and efficiency.

## Within the source code I have replaced the div elements with semantic elements that better describe their function. I renamed elements and then adjusted their corresponding stylesheet elements to preserve the logical structure of the original code. I also changed the title element to contain the name of the company.

## I then added alt attributes to each of the image elements. Because of the generic nature of the images, I chose to write alt captions that reflected the content of the associated paragraph elements. With digital-marketing-meeting.jpeg I ran into some trouble adding an alt attribute - the debug is commented on in the stylesheet.

## With regards to the stylesheet, I preserved the formatting of the page, but consolidated several groups of classes that were each performing similar functions. Comments which explain this can be found in the stylesheet.
